# Backend

## Todo

- Collision
  - On collision detection, change dino sprite, display score, stop side scroll, add play again button
  - Also add high score if functionality is added
- Spacebar link to jump function
  - Jump to avoid collision
  - Change dino animation for jump
- Down arrow link to crouch function
  - Down arrow to avoid collision
  - Change dino animation for crouch running
  - Change back
- Randomly generated obstacles
  - Cactus and birds
  - Different sizes of cactus
  - Different bird heights - 3
  - Maybe add custom obstacles
    - Platforms?
    - Falling objects?
- Keep score when game starts
  - Change day and night depending on score
- Difficulty setting
  - Easy and hard
- Changeable speed

## Additional ideas if I have time

- File manipulation
  - Local high score
    - Needs separate text file, may be too complicated
    - Separate user names?
    - New area and level unlocks based on high scores
  - Cosmetics
    - Themes
    - Areas
    - Skins
- Global leaderboards
  - Needs online server
  - Skin for 1st place?
  - Weekly leaderboard resets
- AI
  - Just complicated in general
  - Needs to perfectly jump and crouch with millisecond reactions
- Multiplayer
  - Flesh out finer details too
